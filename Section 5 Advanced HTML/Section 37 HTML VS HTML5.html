<!-- HTML SEMANTIC ELEMENTS

Helps divide the website into sections. In the pass we used  <div> but now  with
HTML5 we have semantic elements. A semantic element clearly describes its meaning 
to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span>
     - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <header>, <footer>, and <article> 
    - Clearly defines its content.
